A System Development Methodology(SDLC Activities)

Project Identification

2. Projects are basically initiated by users and owners of the system. True or False?
Ans: True

b. What are the 3 ways Projects can be Initiated?
Ans: - Problems: 
          are understandable situations that prevent the organization from fully 
          achieving its purpose goals and objectives
          e.g 
           A business might identify that it is taking too long to fulfill customer 
          orders. A project would be initiated to achieve more responsible and 
          timely order fulfillment. *Problem might be real, suspected or anticipated

     - Opportunity: 
          is a chance to improve the organization even in the absence of specific
          problem
          e.g
          Management is usually receptive of cost cutting ideas, even when costs 
          are not currently considered a problem. Opportunistic improvement is the
          source of many of today's most interesting projects.
         
     - Directive:
          is a new requirement that's imposed by management, government or some
          external influence.
          e.g
          In a government agency, they may mandate that a new set of reports be 
          produced each quarter.
        
          Some directives may be technical
          e.g. Converting inputs from key input through keyboard to using bar codes


PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION PHASE

     - Directives that triggered the project

f. Assuming a project is worth looking at. What are the things that must be established?
Ans: A project plan,
     Interns of Scope *,
     Schedule,
     Resource requirements and 
     budget

g. This phase is concerned with the System Owners. They tend to be concerned with?
Ans: The big picture, not details. They also determine whether resources will be
     committed to the project
8
h. The deliverable of this phase is ____________?

SUMMARY

Preliminary Investigation

Tasks of the Preliminary Investigation
A. List problems, opportunities and directives
B. Negotiate preliminary scope
C. Access project worth
D. Plan the project
E. Present the Project and Plan


A. List problems, opportunities and directives
- Establish an initial baseline of the problem
- Consider perceived constraints (budget, deadline, technology)
- Headed by the System Analyst
=> Problem Statement
   Expressed in Urgency, benefits, priority, possible solution (check Question m1)


B. Negotiate preliminary scope
- Scope defines the boundary of the Project
- Scope can change - but preliminary scope must be established
- headed by Senior Analyst
- Scope is defined in form of Data, Business process, Interface
  Data:
    What type of data are we talking about? School info system may require data about
    students, staff, etc.
  Business process: 
    What business process are included - Order entry, etc
  Interface:
    Locations of regional officies


C. Access the Project Worth
- Questions like - "Is this project worth looking at"
- Will the project return enough value to offset the incured costs?
The project can be cancelled, or scope negotiated


D. Plan the Project
- Once approved, proceed to plan the project.
- Preliminary master plan - includes schedules, resolve assignment to use project
  management software


E. Present the Project Plan
- The project must be presented and defended to the steering committee.

A Steering body is a committee of executive business and systems managers that 
studies and prioritizes competing project proposals to determine which project will 
return the most value to the organization

=> Presentation is Important
Project may be terminated if not endorsed - But if it secures the blessing of the 
System owners and Steering Committee, the project can then proceed

e. What is the Goal of the Problem Analysis Phase?
Ans: The goal of this phase is to study and understand the problem domain well 
     enough to thoroughly analyze the problem, opportunities and constraints

f. List the Tasks of Problem Analysis Phase?
Ans: 2.1. Study the problem domain
     2.2. Analyze problems and opportunities
     2.3. (Optional) Analyze business process
     2.4. Establish System empowerment objective
     2.5. Update project plan
     2.6. Present findings and recommendations


2.1. Study The Problem Domain

g. Discuss the the First Task (Study the Problem domain)?
Ans: During the problem analysis phase, the team initially attempts to learn about 
     the Current System.
     Each System owner, user and analyst brings a different level of understanding 
     to the System - different detail, different vocabulary, different perception 
     and different opinions. A well conducted study can prove revealing to all 
     parties, including the systems own management and users. It is therefore 
     important to study the domain where the problem exist

h. Who leads this task and who facilitates it?
Ans: The Project Manager leads the task and the Systems analyst facilitates it

i. What are the deliverable of this task?
Ans: An understanding of the Problem Domain and business vocabulary.

j. What ever is understood should at always be _________?
Ans: Documented

k. What should the Document Include?
Ans: Data: 
     - List all the things about which the System currently stores data(in files, 
       database, form, etc). Define each thing in business terms. 
       e.g 
       "An order is a business transaction in which a customer requests to purchase 
       a product"
     - Could also list all the requests currently produced by the current system 
       and their purpose
       e.g variation report
   
     Process:
       Define each business event for which a business response(process) is 
       currently implemented. 
       e.g
       "A customer places a new order" or
       "A customer requests changes to a previously placed order" or 
       "A customer cancels an order"

     Interfaces:
       Define all the locations that the current system serves and all the users at
       each location.
       e.g
       The system is currently used at our Regional Offices in West Africa, East 
       Africa and South Africa.
       - Each regional sales office has a sales manager, assistant sales manager, & 
         Administrative assistant
       - To Sales representatives who upload orders and other transactions online

       Extra:
       Another facet of interface is System Interfaces - this are interfaces that
       currently exist between the current information system and other information
       systems and other information systems. This can be listed by the System 
       Information Staff


Documentation
- Data: A 1 page data model for establishing business vocabulary and rules
- Process: A 1 or 2 page functional decomposition diagram should prove sufficient
           to get a feel of the current system
- Interface: A 1 page or use-case diagrams are very useful for illustrating the 
             System's inputs and outputs with other business units and systems


l. Define the Fact-Finding Technique?
Ans: these are useful techniques used in finding about casting system/joint
     repearing* planning* technique/ability to clearly communicate back to the users
     What you have learned about a System is equally important


Task 2.2 Analyze Problem and opportunities

m. How do we go about the "Analyze Problem and opportunities" task?
Ans: we use the cause-and-effect analysis technique to study and determine these 
     causes and effects on the System


Task 2.3 Analyze Business Process

n. How do we "Analyze Business Process" task?
Ans: - Keep focus on the process and not the people, because the owners of the 
       System and users can become dependencies about their existing business
       processes
     - The deliverable: Bigger picture of a form of Data flow diagram which shows
       a) The volume of data flowing through the processes
       b) The response times of each process.
       c) Delays and bottlenecks etc..


Task 2.4 Establish System Empowerment

o. Discuss "Establish System empowerment objective" task?
Ans: Given our understanding of the current system's scope, problem and 
     opportunities we can establish System Improvement objectives:
     - Establish a criteria to which any improvements to the system will be measured
       and also identify any constraints that may limit flexibility in achieving 
       the improvement.
       e.g 
       Decrease by 50% the time spent required in payroll production
       e.x of constraints
       - Schedules: The new system must be operatives by April 15
       - cost:      Should not exceed 250,000
       - Technology:Must be online
       - Policy:    "Policy"


Task 2.5 Update the Project Plan

Task 2.6 Present Findings and Recommendations

p. Discuss "Present Findings and Recommendations" task?
Ans: A formal business report and business presentation to the community. At this
     point, the project can be authorized to continue, 'Adjust scope, cost, 
     schedules or cancel'. The project due to lack of resources or realization of
     benefits or the new system are not likely to exceed the costs

















Lecture 5


PAGE 45 - 60

1. What is Fact-finding?
Ans: these are specific methods for finding information of the system

b. During your Fact-finding exercise. You will usually come across or analyze
   sensitive information. How do you handle those when it happens?
Ans: - Protect Security & Privacy of any facts or data
     - Do not discuss sensitive issues in public
     - Do not be careless. Your notes, documents should be kept safe

c. Give me an example of sensitive information?
Ans: Employee profile showing his/her salaries, performance history, medical history 
     or even career plans 

d. What Fact-Finding Methods are available?
Ans: - Sampling of existing documentation, forms and databases
     - Research and site visits
     - Observation of the Work Environment
     - Questionnaires
     - Interviews
     - Prototyping
     - Joint requirements planning

     An analyst usually applies several of these techniques during a single systems
     project.

a1. A good analysts always gets facts first form _______________ rather than _____?
Ans: Existing documentations rather than from people

a2. An analyst also wants to study the Business Function. Such as?
Ans: - Company's mission
     - Formal Objectives
     - Policy manuals
     - Standard Operation Procedures (SOP)
     - e.t.c

a3. Because it would be impractical to study every occurrence of every form or 
   record in a file or database, systems analyst normally use _____________?
Ans: Sampling Techniques

a4. What is Sampling?
Ans: its the process of collecting a representative sample of documents, forms, and
     records

a5. But what does representative mean?
Ans: basically the systems analyst wants to sample enough forms to cover up for the
     full nature and complexity of the rest of the form


B. Research and site visits

b1. Discuss the "Research and site visits" fact-finding technique?
Ans: In this technique, we thoroughly research the problem domain. Most problems 
     are not unique and have been solved before. Organizations often contact or
     perform site visits at companies they know have experienced similar problems.
     If these companies are willing to share.

     e.g 
     Just like the time Peter Obi went to Egypt to check out how they are able
     to produce 24 Hours of light everyday. Most problems are not unique and have
     been solved before

b2. What are some other ways we can find solved similar problems?
Ans: - Computer trade journals
     - Reference books are also good
     - Software packages may already exist to solve your problem



C. Observation

3. Observation is an effective data-collection technique for obtaining an 
   understanding of a system. True or False?
Ans: True

c2. What is Observation?
Ans: Observation is a fact-finding technique wherein the systems analyst either
     participates in or watches a person perform activities to learn about the 
     system.

c3. This technique is often used when?
Ans: Validity of data collected through other methods is in question ? or when it's
     too complex

c4. Observation can be a very useful technique if you have the ability to?
Ans: Observe thoroughly and accurately

c5. What are the Advantages?
Ans: - Data gathered using Observation are highly reliable
     - Complex tasks are sometimes difficult to clearly explain. Through 
       Observation systems analyst can identify tasks that have been missed or 
       inaccurately described
     - Observation is not expensive compared to other fact-finding techniques
     - it allows the systems analyst to do work measurements

c6. What are the Disadvantages?
Ans: - people are uncomfortable when watched
     - time of observation might not involve the level of difficulty or volume 
       normally experienced
     - System activities may take place at odd times causing a scheduling 
       inconvenience for the systems analyst
     - The tasks being observed are subject to interrupt
     - People may let you see what they want you to see

c7. What are the times most appropriate to make observations?
Ans: Low, Normal and Peak periods of operations


c8. What is Work Sampling?
Ans: it is a fact-finding technique that involves a large number of observations 
     taken at random intervals

c9. List some guideline for Sampling?
Ans: - Keep a low profile
     - take notes during observation or immediately after
     - review observation notes with appropriate individuals
     - don't interrupt the individuals being observed
     - don't focus heavily on trivial activities
     - don't make assumptions

c10. What is the most effective way to perform observation?
Ans: Living the System

c11. What happens in Living the System Observation?
Ans: System analyst actively performs the role of the user being observed for a 
     short time



D. Questionnaires

4. What are Questionnaires?
Ans: These are special-purpose documents that allow the analyst to collect 
     information and opinions from respondents

d1. The use of questionnaires have been heavily criticized and is often avoided by
   systems analysts. True or False?
Ans: True

d2. The reason for the criticism is that people using questionnaires don't understand
   the pros and cons?
Ans: True

d3. What are the Advantages?
Ans: - They can be answered quickly
     - They are not expensive
     - They allow respondents to remain anonymous
     - Responses can be tabulated and analyzed quickly

d4. What are the Disadvantages?
Ans: - Number of respondents are often low
     - No guarantee an individual will answer or expand on all the questions
     - Questionnaires tend to be inflexible
     - Impossible to analyze respondent's body language
     - Unable to clarify an incomplete answer to any question
     - Good questionnaires are difficult to prepare

d5. What are the 2 types of Questionnaires?
Ans: 1. Free-format  questionnaires
     2. Fixed-format questionnaires

d6. Explain the 2 types of Questionnaires?
Ans: Free-format questionnaires:
        Offers the respondent greater latitiude in the answer. A question is asked,
     and the respondent records the answer in the space provided after the question

     Fixed-format questionnaires:
        Offers the respondent questions that require selection of predefined 
     responses
     e.g 
     What is your favorite sport?
     a) Football
     b) Basketball
     c) Ufc
     d) American Football



E. Interviews

5. The use of personal interview is generally recognized as the most important and
   most often used fact-finding technique. True or Yes?
Ans: True

e1. What are Interviews?
Ans: these are fact-finding techniques whereby the systems analysts collects 
     information from individuals through face-to-face interaction

e2. An interviewer must have good human relation skills. True or False?
Ans: True

e3. What are the Advantages?
Ans: - Opportunity of the interviewer (or systems analyst) to motivate the 
       interviewee to respond freely and openly to questions.
     - allows the interviewer probe for more feedback from the interviewee
     - allows interviewer the opportunity to adapt or reword questions foreach individuals
     - allows the interviewer to observe the interviewee's body language

e4. What are the Disadvantages?
Ans: - Time consuming and costly
     - Success of interviews is highly dependent on the system analysts human 
       relation skills
     - may be impossible due to location of interviewee

e5. What are the 2 types of Interviews?
Ans: Structured and Unstructured Interviews

e6. Explain both types of Interviews?
Ans: Unstructured Interviews
        these are conducted with only a general goal or subject in mind and with
     very few, if any, specific questions. They depend on the interviewee to directed
     the conversation. This type of interview frequently gets off track
   
     Structured Interviews
        the interviewer usually has a specific set of questions to ask the interviewee.
 
e7. How does one Conduct a Successful Interview?
Ans: I.   Selecting appropriate individuals to interview
     II.  Preparing extensively
     III. Conducting the interview properly
     IV.  Following up on the interview


I. Selecting appropriate individuals to interview
e8. How does one select an Interviewee?
Ans: - Use organizational chart
     - Make appointments
     - Get supervisors permission
     - Make sure a location is available

II. Preparing Extensively
e9. How does one prepare for the Interview?
Ans: - The interviewee is able to detect an unprepared interviewer and may resent 
       the lack of preparations. Therefore the interviewer should prepare properly
     - The interviewee should be notified about the subject of the interview
     - The systems analyst should prepare an interview guide

e10. What is an Interview Guide?
Ans: A list of specific questions the interviewer will ask the interviewee

e11. Questions should be carefully chosen. Standard ones begin with?
Ans: Who, What, When, Where, Why and how much

e12. What are the types of questions to avoid?
Ans: Loaded  questions
     Leading questions
     Biased  questions

III. Conduct the Interview
e13. An actual interview can be characterized into 3 phases. Name them?
Ans: The Opening, Body and Conclusion

e14. Explain these 3 phases?
Ans: 1. The Opening:
           used to influence and motivate the interviewee to participate and 
        communicate by establishing an ideal environment
     2. The Body:
           this is the most time-consuming phase. This is where you obtain the 
        interviewee's responses to your list of questions
     3. The Conclusion:
           this is where the interviewer expresses their appreciation and provide
        answers to any questions posed by the interviewee. This phase is important
        to maintain trust with the interviewee

e15. State the Do's and Don'ts in an interview
Ans: Do
     - Be courteous
     - Listen carefully
     - Maintain control
     - Probe
     - Observe mannerisms and nonverbal communication
     - Be patient
     - Keep interviewee at ease
     - Maintain self-control

     Avoid
     - Continuing an interview unnecessarily
     - Assuming an answer is leading nowhere
     - Revealing verbal and nonverbal clues
     - Using jargon
     - Revealing your personal biases
     - Talking instead of listening
     - Assuming anything about the topic and the interviewee
     - Tape recording - a sign of poor listening skills

IV. Follow Up on the Interview
e16. How does an interview follow up on the interview?
Ans: The interviewer should send the interviewee a memo that summarizes the interview.
     This memo should remind the interviewees of their contributions to the project
     and allow them to clarify any misinterpretations

e17. To conduct a successful interview you must distinguish between hearing & 
   listening. True or False?
Ans: True

e18. What is Body Language?
Ans: it is all the nonverbal information that we all communicate and are usually 
     unaware of.

e19. Research has determined a startling fact-- of a person's total feelings, only 7%
   are communicated verbally(in words), 38% are communicated by the tone of the 
   voice used, and 55% are communicated by facial and body expressions. If you 
   listen only to someone's words, you are missing the most of what that person is
   saying. True or False?
Ans: True

e20. What are the 3 aspects of the body language do we want to focus on?
Ans: facial disclosure, eye contact and posture

e21. Talk about these 3 aspects of body language?
Ans: 1. Facial Disclosure:
           You can sometimes understand how people feel by watching the expressions 
        on their faces. Many common emotions have easily recognizable facial 
        expressions associated with them. However the face is one of the most 
        controlled parts of the body. Some people who know this are very good at
        controlling their expression

     2. Eye Contact:
           This is the least controlled part of the face. Have you ever spoken to 
        someone who will not look directly at you? How did it make you feel? A 
        continual lack of eye contact may indicate uncertainty.

     3. Posture:
           This is the least controlled aspect of the body. Body postures holds a
        wealth of information for the astute analyst. A good analyst would watch the
        audience for changes in posture that could indicate anxiety, disagreement, 
        or boredom.

e22. Complete the statement. If eyese are "the window to the soul" _____________?
Ans: be sure to search for any informations they may provide

e24. What are Proxemics?
Ans: it is the relationship between people and the space around them.

e25. People are very territorial about their space. Observe where your classmates sit
   in a course that does not have assigned seats for example. A good analyst is 
   aware of four spatial zones. Name them?
Ans: Intimate Zone - closer than 1.5 feet
     Personal Zone - form 1.5 - 4 feet
     Social Zone   - from 4   - 12 feet
     Public zone   - beyond 12 feet

     certain types of communications occur only in some of these zones.



F. Prototyping

6. What is Discovery prototyping?
Ans: it is the act of building a small-scale, representative (or working model) of
     the users' requirements to discover or 
     y those requirements

f2. What are some Advantages?
Ans: - Allows users and developers to experiment with the software and develop an 
       understanding of how the system might work
     - Aids in determining the feasibility and usefulness of the System before high
       development costs are incurred.
     - Serves as a training mechanism for users

1. What is Feasibility Study?
Ans: it is the measure of how beneficial or practical the development of an 
     information system will be to an organization

b. What is Feasibility Analysis?
Ans: It is the process by which feasibility is measured

c. In analysis we Identify candidate solutions and make decisions. True or False?
Ans: True

d. What are the Four Test for Feasibility?
Ans: - operational 
     - technical 
     - schedule and 
     - economic feasibility

e. Discuss the Four test of Feasibility?
Ans: 1. Operational feasibility
        - is the problem worth solving? or will the solution to the problem work?
        - is the solution compliant with the laws and regulations?
        - will the solution fulfill the users requirement?
        - how will the solution change the users work environment
        - ow do users feel about the proposed solution?

     2. Technical Feasibility
        - is the proposed technology or solution practical?
        - do we currently posses the necessary technology?
        - do we posses the necessary technical expertise
        - does the staff have the technical expertise to design and build this solution?

     3. Schedule Feasibility
        - Given our technical expertise are the project deadlines reasonable?
        or
        - can the solution be designed and implemented within the given time frame?

     4. Economic Feasibility
        - How much will the systems cost?
        - What benefits will the system provide?
          - tangible benefits
          - intangible benefits
        - Is the proposed system cost-effective?


f. List some cost-benefit analysis techniques
Ans: - Break-even analysis
     - Cashflow analysis
     - Return on Investment analysis
     - Net present value (NPV)

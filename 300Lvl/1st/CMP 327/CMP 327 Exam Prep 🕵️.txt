Database Management System (DBMS)

2. What are Database Management Systems (DBMS)?
Ans: Database management system is a software used to manage the database. 

b. Give me some examples of DBMS?
Ans: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, Amazon SimpleDB (cloud based) , etc.

c. DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations such as 
Ans: - database creation, 
     - storing data, 
     - updating data
     - creating a Tables

d. What are the tasks DBMS allows users to perform?
Ans: - Data Definition
           creation, modification, and removal of database and database objects
     - Data Manipulation
           insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database
     - Data Retrieval
           retrieves data from the database to be used by applications
     - User Administration
           registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing 
           data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance 
           and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure
          
e. List and Explain all 7 characteristics of DBMS?
Ans: 1. Data stored into Tables:
          Data is never directly stored into the database. Data is stored into 
          tables, created inside the database. DBMS also allows to have 
          relationships between tables which makes the data more meaningful and 
          connected. You can easily understand what type of data is stored where by 
          looking at all the tables created in a database
     2. Reduced Redundancy:
          In the modern world hard drives are very cheap, but earlier when hard 
          drives were too expensive, unnecessary repetition of data in database was 
          a big problem. But DBMS follows Normalization which divides the data in 
          such a way that repetition is minimal.
     3. Data Consistency:
          On Live data, i.e. data that is being continuously updated and added, 
          maintaining the consistency of data can become a challenge. But DBMS 
          handles it all by itself.
     4. Support Multiple user and Concurrent Access:
          DBMS allows multiple users to work on it(update, insert, delete data) 
          at the same time and still manages to maintain the data consistency.
     5. Query Language:
          DBMS provides users with a simple Query language, using it allows us 
          fetch, insert, delete and update the data in the database.
     6. Security:
          The DBMS also takes care of the security of data, protecting the data 
          from un-authorized access. In a typical DBMS, we can create user accounts 
          with different access permissions, by which we can easily secure our 
          data by restricting user access.
     7. DBMS supports transactions, which allows us to better handle and manage 
        data integrity in real world applications where multi-threading is 
        extensively used.
        

f. List 5 Advantages of DBMS?
Ans: - Segregation of application program.
     - Minimal data duplication or data redundancy (or reduced redundancy).
     - Easy retrieval of data using the Query Language.
     - Reduced development time and maintenance need.
     - With Cloud Data centers, we now have Database Management Systems capable 
       of storing almost infinite data.
     - Seamless integration into the application programming languages which makes 
       it very easy to add a database to almost any application or website.  

g. List 3 disadvantages of DBMS
Ans: - It's Complexity
     - Except MySQL which is open source, licensed DBMSs are generally costly
     - They are large in size

h. What are the Functions of a DBMS?
Ans: - organizes your files to give you more control over your data
     - makes it possible for users to create, edit and update data in our db files
     - it provides the following
       - Concurrency: 
             means multiple users can access data in db at the same time
       - Security: 
             security rules to determine access rights of users data
       - Backup and recovery: 
             offers processes to backup data regularly and enables data recovery 
             if any problem occurs
       - Integrity: 
             db structure and rules improve the integrity of the data
       - Data descriptions: 
             a data dictionary provides a description of the data
     
i. Administering the database is the responsibility of the __________?
Ans: Database Administrator (DBA)
     
j. What are the roles of a DBA?
Ans: - Selecting the server hardware on which the database software will run
     - Installing and configuring the Oracle 10g software on the server hardware
     - Creating the database itself
     - Creating and managing the tables and other objects used to manage the 
       application data
     - Creating and managing database users
     - Establishing reliable backup and recovery processes for the database
     - Monitoring and tuning database performance


Data Abstraction
k. One of the major purposes of a database system is to provide users with an 
   abstract view of the system. The system hides certain details of how data 
   is stored and maintained.True or False?
Ans: True

l. Should Complexities also be hidden from database users?
Ans: Yes

m. There are several levels of abstraction. List them?
Ans: 1. Internal Level
     2. Conceptual Level
     3. External View Level

n. Explain all 3 levels of abstraction?
Ans: Internal Level
        Shows the physical representation of database on the computer, how the 
        data are stored. e.g. index, B-tree, hashing.
     Conceptual Level
        Defines logical structure of a database, describes all entities, their 
        attributes, and their relationship. Describes the constraints on the data, 
        semantic information about the data and security and integrity information
     External Level
        Describes part of the database for a particular group of users, how users 
        see the data. e.g. tellers in a bank get a view of customer accounts, but 
        not of payroll data.

o. Draw a diagram show all 3 levels of Data Abstraction?
Ans: Draw it






















LECTURE 2

Ans: Relation: is a table with columns and rows
        Extra:
         - Only applies to logical structure of the database, not the physical 
           structure.
         - A relation corresponds to an entity set, or collection of entities. 
     Entity:    is a person, place, event, or thing about which data is collected
     Attribute: is a named column of a relation. 
         - It corresponds to a characteristic of an entity. 
         - They are also called fields
     Tuple:     is a row of a relation
     Degree:    is the number of attributes in a relation
     Cardinality:is the number of tuples in a relation
     Domain:    is the set of allowable values for one or more attributes
     Relational Database: is a collection of normalized relations with distinct 
                          relation names
     Relational Schema:   is a set of relational tables and associated items that 
                          are related to one another. 

     Relational database schema: is a set of relation schemas, each with a 
                                 distinct name


h. Draw an example of two tables having a relationship?
Ans: Draw it

     - Each cell of relation contains exactly one atomic (single) value.
     - Each attribute has a distinct name.
     - Values of an attribute are all from the same domain.
     - Each tuple is distinct; there are no duplicate tuples.
     - Order of attributes has no significance.
     - Order of tuples has no significance, theoretically

j. What is Data Modeling?
Ans: Data modeling is the process of creating a data model for the data to be 
     stored in a Database.

k. Data model is a conceptual representation of  _____, ________ and _______?
Ans: Data objects, the associations between different data objects, the rules

l. A Data Model is used to document, define, organize, and show how the data 
   structures within a given database, architecture, application, or platform are 
   connected, stored, accessed, and processed within the given system and between 
   other systems. True or Yes?
Ans: True

m. Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business 
   rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. True or Yes?
Ans: True

n. Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, 
   and security while ensuring quality of the data. True or Yes?
Ans: True

o. Data model emphasizes on what data is needed and how it should be organized 
   instead of what operations need to be performed on the data. True or Yes?
Ans: True

p. What are the uses/primary goal of using Data Models?
Ans: - Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately 
       represented
     - A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and 
       logical levels
     - Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and 
       foreign keys and stored procedures.
     - It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database 
       developers to create a physical database.
     - It is also helpful to identify missing and redundant data.
     - Though its creation is time consuming at the initial stage, in the long run
       it makes your IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster


q. List all 3 types of Data Models?
Ans: - Conceptual
     - Logical
     - Physical 

r. Discus all 3 types of Data Model?
Ans: Conceptual Model:
        defines WHAT the system contains. 
        - It is typically created by Business stakeholders and Data Architects. 
     Logical Model:
        defines HOW the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS
        - It is typically created by Data Architects and Business Analysts.
     Physical Model:
        Describes HOW the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS
        - It is typically created by DBA and developers





Concept Data Model
2. What is the Conceptual Model?
Ans: it's a data model whose main aim is to establish the entities, their attributes, 
     and their relationships

aa. What are the 3 basic elements of the Conceptual model?
Ans: - Entity, 
     - Attribute, 
     - Relationship

aaaa. What does the ER MODEL define?
Ans: The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database

b. Discuss Entities?
Ans: An entity can be a real-world object, either animate or inanimate, they are  
     easily identifiable. E.g, in a `school database`, students, teachers, classes, 
     and courses offered can be considered entities. All these entities have 
     some attributes or properties that give them their identity.

b1. Discuss Entity sets?
Ans: An entity set is a collection of similar types of entities. An entity set may 
     contain entities with attribute sharing similar values. For example, a 
     Students set may contain all the students of a school; likewise a Teachers 
     set may contain all the teachers of a school from all faculties. Entity 
     sets need not be disjoint. 


c. What are Attributes?
Ans: Attributes are the properties of entities.For example, a student entity may 
    have name, class, and age as attributes.

d. Give 2 examples of Domains in attributes?
Ans: - a student's name attribute cannot be a numeric value
     -  A student's age cannot be a negative number 

e. List the Types of Attributes?
Ans: Simple    attributes
     Composite attributes
     Derived   attributes
     Single-value attribute
     Multi-value  attribute

f. Explain the 3 types of attributes?
Ans: Simple attributes: 
        this are atomic values/attributes that cannot be further divided
        e.g a students phone number
     Composite attributes:
        are attributes that can be further divided into simple attributes.
        e.g student's full name may be divided into - first_name, and last_name
     Derived attributes:
        attributes that do not exist in the physical database, but their values are
        derived from other attributes present in the database
        e.g age can be derived from date_of_birth
     Single-value attribute:
        Single-value attributes contain single value
        e.g: Social_Security_Number.
     Multi-value attribute:
        Multi-value attributes may contain more than one values. 
        e.g a person can have more than one phone number, email_address, etc.

Set and Keys
g. What are Keys?
Ans: Key is an attribute or collection of attributes that uniquely identifies an 
     entity in an entity set
     e.g matric_number of a student makes him/her identifiable amongst other students

h. What are the 3 types of Keys?
Ans: - Super     key
     - Candidate Key
     - Primary   Key

i. Explain the above types of keys
Ans: Super key:     A set of attributes (1 or more) that collectively identifies 
                    an entity in an entity set
     Candidate Key: A minimal super key is called a candidate key. An entity 
                    set may have more than one candidate key
     Primary Key:   A  primary key is one of the candidate keys chosen by the 
                    database designer to uniquely identify an entity in an entity set. 
 
J. The association among entities is called a __________?
Ans: Relationship

k. Give me 2 examples of relationship?
Ans: An employee works_at Omega
     A  student enrolls in a course
     - In the above, works_at and enrolls are the relationships

l. What is a Relationship Set?
Ans: it is a set of relationships of similar type

m. Like entities, a relationship too can have attributes. True or False?
Ans: True

n. Attributes of Relationships are called ____________?
Ans: Descriptive attributes

o. What is the Degree of a Relationship?
Ans: The number of participating entities in a relationship defines the degree of 
     the relationship.
     - Binary  = degree 2
     - Ternary = degree 3
     - n-ary   = degree


Mapping Cardinalities
p. What is cardinality?
Ans: it is the number of entities in one entity set, which can be associated with 
     the number of entities of other set via relationship set

q. What are the 4 types of Relationship?
Ans: One-to-one
     One-to-many
     Many-to-one
     Many-to-Many

r. Explain all of the 4 types of Relationship and also use diagrams?
Ans: One-to-one:
        One entity from entity set A can be associated with at most one entity 
        of entity set B and vice versa
     One-to-many:
        One entity from entity set A can be associated with more than one entities of entity set B, however an entity from entity set B can be 
        associated with at most one entity. 
     Many-to-one:
        More than one entities from entity set A can be associated with at most 
        one entity of entity set B, however an entity from entity set B can be 
        associated with more than one entity from entity set A.
     Many-to-many:
        One entity from A can be associated with more than one entity from B and 
        vice versa. 

s. List 3 characteristics of a conceptual data model
Ans: - Offers Organization-wide coverage of the business concepts.
     - This type of Data Models are designed and developed for a business audience.
     - The conceptual model is developed independently of hardware specifications 
       like data storage capacity, location or software specifications like DBMS 
       vendor and technology. 
       - The focus is to represent data as a user will see it in the "real world."


Logical Data Model
3. What is Logical Data Model?
Ans: it adds further information to the conceptual model elements. 
     or
     It defines the structure of the data elements and set the relationships 
     between them.
     e.g 
     - Firstname (string)
     - Age (number)


b. What is the advantage of the Logical Data Model?
Ans: it is to provide a foundation to form the base for the Physical Model.

c. At this Data Modeling level, no primary or secondary key is defined. At this 
   Data modeling level, you need to verify and adjust the connector details that 
   were set earlier for relationships. True or False?
Ans: True

d. What are the Characteristics of a Logical Data Model?
Ans: - Describes data needed for a single project but could integrate with other 
       logical data models based on the scope of the project.
     - Designed and developed independently from the DBMS.
     - Data attributes will have data types with exact precisions and length.
     - Normalization processes to the model is applied typically till 3NF.


Physical Data Model
4. What is the Physical Data Model?
Ans: it is the database specific implementation of the data model
     e.g
     Firstname (Varchar)
     Age (integer)
     Empno (Varchar) Primary key

b. It offers an abstraction of the database and helps generate schema. This is 
   because of the richness of meta-data offered by a Physical Data Model.True or False?
Ans: True

c. The Physical Data Model also helps to _________________________?
Ans: visualize database structure. It helps to model database columns keys, 
     constraints, indexes, triggers, and other RDBMS features

d. What are the Characteristics of the Physical Data Model?
Ans: - It describes data need for a single project or application though it may be 
       integrated with other physical data models based on project scope.
     - it contains relationships between tables that which addresses cardinality 
       and nullability of the relationships.
     - Developed for a specific version of a DBMS, location, data storage or 
       technology to be used in the project.
     - Columns should have exact data types, lengths assigned and default values.
     - Primary and Foreign keys, views, indexes, access profiles, and authorizations,
       etc. are defined.


Advantages and Disadvantages of Data Model
e. What are the Advantages of Data Model?
Ans: - The main goal of designing data model is to make certain that data 
       objects offered by the functional team are represented accurately.
     - The data model should be detailed enough to be used for building the 
       physical database.
     - The information in the data model can be used for defining the relationship 
       between tables, primary and foreign keys, and stored procedures.
     - Data Model helps business's to communicate within and across organizations.
     - Data model helps to documents data mappings in ETL process
     - Help to recognize correct sources of data to populate the model

f. What are the Disadvantages of Data Model?
Ans: - To develop Data model one should know physical data stored characteristics.
     - This is a navigational system which produces complex application 
       development, management. 
     - Even smaller change made in structure require modification in the entire 
       application.
     - There is no set data manipulation language in DBMS.

Constraints
2. What are constraints?
Ans: Constraint is the way DBMS prevents the entry of illegal data. It is the rules 
     about how tables are related and how data are stored in the table.

b. What are the Types of Table Constraints
Ans: Constraint Type      Description
     - Not null           A value must be supplied for this column, but values do 
                          not have to be unique
     - Unique Key         Every value in this column must be unique, but null 
                          values are allowed
     - Primary Key        Every value in the column must be unique and cannot be 
                          null
     - Foreign Key        Every value in the column must match a value in another 
                          column in this table or some other table; otherwise, 
                          the value is null.
     - Check              The value entered in the table must match one of the 
                          specified values for this column.

Database Auditing
c. What is Auditing?
Ans: Auditing is the monitoring and recording of selected user database actions

d. It can be based on individual actions, such as the type of SQL statement 
   executed, or on combinations of factors that can include user name, application, 
   time, and so on. True or False?
Ans: True

e. Security policies can trigger auditing when specified elements in an Oracle 
   database are accessed or altered, including the contents within a specified
   object. True or False?
Ans: True

f. What is Auditing typically used for?
Ans: - Enabling future accountability for current actions taken in a particular 
       schema, table, or row, or affecting specific content
     - Deter users (or others) from inappropriate actions based on that accountability
     - Investigate suspicious activity
     - Notify an auditor that an unauthorized user is manipulating or deleting data 
       and that the user has more privileges than expected which can lead to 
       reassessing user authorizations
     - Monitor and gather data about specific database activities
     - Detect problems with an authorization or access control implementation
     
g. What are the Auditing Types and descriptions?
Ans: Statement
     Privilege
     Fine-Grained
     Schema Object


Database Security

Ans: hardware, software, people and data

k. List some components of the Database that Database Security helps us protect?
Ans: - Data stored in database
     - Database server
     - Database management system (DBMS)
     - Other database workflow applications

l. Database security aims to minimize losses caused by anticipated events in a 
   cost effective manner without unduly constraining the users. True or False?
Ans: True

m. The complete solution to data security must meet the three main requirements of 
   ________, ________ and _________?
Ans: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

n. Explain the 3 main requirements to Data Security?
Ans: Confidentiality:
        protecting information from being disclosed to unauthorized parties
     Integrity:
        protecting information from being changed by unauthorized parties
     Availability:
        availability of information to authorized parties only when requested

o. Database security is generally ______, _______ and _________ by a DBA and/or 
   other information security professionals?
Ans: planned, implemented and maintained

p. Some of the ways database security is analyzed and implemented include. List 4?
Ans: - Restricting unauthorized access and use by implementing strong and 
       multi-factor access and data management controls
     - Load/stress testing and capacity testing of a database to ensure it does not 
       crash in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack or user overload
     - Physical security of the database server and backup equipment from theft and 
       natural disasters
     - Reviewing existing system for any known or unknown vulnerabilities and 
       defining and implementing a road map/plan to mitigate them



3. What is Authentication?
Ans: it is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on 
     file in a database of authorized users' information on a local OS or within an
     authentication server. If the credentials match, the process is completed 
     and the user is granted authorization for access.

     Or
 
     It is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who 
     or what it is declared to be.

b. What is an Authentication Factor?
Ans: it is a category of credential used for identifying verification

c. What are the 3 main Authentication Factor categories?
Ans: - Knowledge  factors
     - Possession factors
     - Inherence  factors

d. Explain the 3 main Authentication factors categories?
Ans: Knowledge factors:
        a category of authentication credentials consisting of information that 
        the user possesses, such as a personal identification number (PIN), a user 
        name, a password or the answer to a secret question.
     Possession factors:
        a category of credentials based on items that the user has with them, 
        typically a hardware device such as a security token or a mobile phone 
        used in conjunction with a software token.
     Inherence factors:
        a category of user authentication credentials consisting of elements that 
        are integral to the individual in question, in the form of biometric data.


e. What is Authorization?
Ans: it is the process of giving someone permission to do or have something.

f. What is Access control
Ans: Access controls for a database system is based on the granting and revoking
     privileges. 

g. What are Privileges? 
Ans: privilege allows a user to create or access some database object or to run 
     certain DBMS utilities.


h. Discuss the below topics
   a. Discretionary security mechanism
   b. Mandatory security mechanism
   c. Backup and Recovery
Ans: Discretionary security mechanisms:
     - Privilege grants allow specific users to perform specific operations on 
       specific data
     - Initial grants start with DBA
     - Grants may be passed on between users
     Mandatory security mechanisms
     - Enforce multi-level security
     - Data and users are classified into security classes
     - Typically, user can only see data which has a lower (or same) classification 
       as themselves
     - Role-based security is similar
     Backup and Recovery
     - Backup is the process of periodically taking a copy of the database and log 
       file (and possibly programs) on to offline storage media.
     - A DBMS should provide facilities to assist with the recovery of database 
       following failure.
     - Journaling is the process of keeping and maintaining a log file (or journal) 
       of all changes made to the database to enable recovery to be 
     - undertaken effectively in the event of failure.

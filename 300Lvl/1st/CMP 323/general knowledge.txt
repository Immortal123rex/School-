1. What is Agile Software Development?
Ans: Agile software development is a methodology for managing and completing software development projects. 
     It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction through the early and continuous delivery 
     of working software.

b. How does it actually work(Give details)?
Ans: Agile software development typically involves a team of developers working in short iterations, called sprints, 
     which usually last 1-4 weeks. The team works together to define and prioritize a set of features or requirements 
     for the software, and then sets goals for the sprint.

     During the sprint, the team holds daily stand-up meetings, called Scrums, to discuss progress and identify any 
     obstacles that need to be addressed. The team also conducts regular reviews and retrospectives to assess what 
     is working well and what can be improved.

     At the end of each sprint, the team delivers a working version of the software that includes new features or 
     enhancements. This allows the customer or end-user to provide feedback and make suggestions for further 
     development.

     The team then uses this feedback to plan the next sprint, and the process is repeated until the software is 
     complete. The Agile development approach encourages a collaborative and adaptive process, where the team and the 
     customer work together to deliver a high-quality product that meets the customer's needs.

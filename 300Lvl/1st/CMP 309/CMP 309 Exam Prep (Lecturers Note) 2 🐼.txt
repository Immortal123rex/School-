CMP 309 Exam Prep 

How To Study the Material

Tips: 
- Best to study using the github repo link
  https://github.com/danielchukwu/School-/tree/master/300Lvl/1st

- Use a laptop or device with a relatively big screen to study
- Glancing through the questions and answers may not cement the knowledge. 
  But answering them as you go through them on some book or paper repeatedly 
  definitely will





Lecture 7


System Design Phase

1a. What is the Information System Design Phase?
Ans: Information System design are those tasks that focus on the specification of a
     detailed computer-based solution - (Physical design)

b. What is Application architecture?
Ans: it describes the pattern and techniques used to design ... an application

Tasks 5.1

c. List all the tasks involved in Information System Design Phase
Ans: 5.1 Application Architecture (defines the technologies to be used)
     5.2 Design the Systems Database
     5.3 Design the systems interface (Input Screen)
     5.4 Package design specification (to guide the programmer in implementation)
     5.5 Update project plan


System Construction / Implementation Phase

a. What is System Construction?
Ans: It is the development, installation and testing of system components

b. What is System Implementation?
Ans: It is the delivery of that system into production (meaning day-to-day operations)

c. What is the purpose of this System Construction/Implementation?
Ans: it is to develop and test functional systems that fulfils business and design
     requirements and to also implement the interfaces between the new system and 
     the existing production systems

d. ________ is generally the major aspect of this phase?
Ans: Programming

e. List all the tasks involved in System Construction Phase?
Ans: 6.1 Build and test network (if necessary)
     6.2 Build and Test Databases
     6.3 Install and Test New Software packages (if necessary)

d. Discuss the Tasks involved in System Construction Phase?
Ans: 6.1 Build and test network (if necessary)
         - in many cases new systems are built around existing networks - if so 
           skip this task else you must implement the network architecture
         - the task is performed by - network administrator; or a network designer
     6.2 Build and Test Databases
         - this is done by a database specialist
         - the input to this task are the database schemas specified during the design
         - final product, should be the populated database
     6.3 Install and Test New Software packages (if necessary)
         - this involves all the stakeholders
           There are 3 levels of testing
           a) Stub testing: 
                is the test performed on events or modules of the program. In other 
              words it is the testing of an isolated subset of the program.
           b) Unit or Program testing:
                is the testing of an entire program. In other words its a test where
              by all the events or modules that have been coded and stub tested for 
              a program are tested as an integrated unit
           c) Systems testing:
                Ensures that application programs written and tested in isolation
              work properly when they are integrated into the total program


i. Once the system test is completed and successful. What is next?
Ans: We can proceed to the implementation of the System






The Implementation Phase

2. What happens in the implementation phase?
Ans: here the new system is delivered into operations

b. List all the tasks involved in the Implementation Phase?
Ans: 7.1 Conduct System Test
     7.2 Prepare a Conversion Plan

b1. Explain the Tasks?
Ans: .1 Conduct System Test:
         - the input to this phase is the new system with observation from the 
           previous phase (if any)
     7.2 Prepare a Conversion Plan
         - once a successful system test has been completed, we can begin 
           preparations to place the new system into operation
         - the plan include => databases to be installed
         - end user to any and documentation
         - strategy for converting from the old system to the new system

         This is mostly done by the project manager

C. Methods of System Conversion plan may include the following. List all?
Ans: i) Abrupt cut-over
           the old system is terminated and the new system is placed into operations
           - this is a high-risk approach because their may still be major problems
             that won't be uncovered until the system has been in operations for at 
             least one business period

     ii) Parallel Conversion
           both the old and the new systems are operated for sometime period. This 
           ensures that all major problems in the new System gets solved before the
           old system is discarded.
           Advantage and disadvantage
           - This strategy minimizes the risk of major flaws in the new system 
           - Sadly, the cost of running the two systems concurrently may be high
           
     iii) Location Conversion
           when the same system would be used in numerous geo locations, it is 
           converted in one location first, when it is tested and trusted then it
           will be deployed to the other locations

     iv) Staged Conversion
           in this system conversion the new system is implemented in stages, 
           rather than all at once. Each version of the new system is converted as it is developed

d. The conversion plan includes the ___________?
Ans: System acceptance test plan
      
e. What is the System acceptance test plan?
Ans: it is the final opportunity for end users, management, and other stakeholders
     to accept or reject the system - this is done using real data

     Or 

     it is the final test performed by end users using real data. 

f. System acceptance plan addresses three levels of acceptance testing. Name them?
Ans: Verification testing
     Validation   testing
     Audit        testing

g. Explain the 3 levels of a acceptance testing?
Ans: Verification testing:
         runs the system on simulated environment using simulated data. 
         - The simulated test is primarily looking for errors and omissions 
           regarding end-user and design specifications that were specified in the 
           earlier phase but not fulfilled during construction
     Validation testing:
         runs the system in a live environment using real data. It is sometimes
         called beta testing
         - during this testing, a number of items are tested including
            - system performance (response time)
            - back up and recovery. etc.
     Audit testing
         it certifies that the system is free of errors and is ready to be placed
         into operation.

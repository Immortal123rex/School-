g.

h. An information system is any continuation of people, hardware, software, 
   communication networks and data resources that collects, transforms and 
   distributes information in an organization

i.

k. The Information System diagram implies that one cannot do with out the other

j. Activities of an Information System:
   Input data
   Processing of data into information
   Output of information
   Storage of data resources
   Central of Systems Performance





2a. Data is a stream of raw facts representing events such as business transactions,
    simple observations e.t.c..
    - easily structured
    - easily captured on machines
    - easily transfered, often quantified

b. Information is data endowed with relevance, useful to humans in decision making
   - requires analysis/processing
   - it helps in processes such as decision making

c. Knowledge is information from the human mind which guides the human behavior in
   correct ways
   - hard to structure
   - difficult to capture on machine
   - hard to transfer

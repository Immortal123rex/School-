1. Data management is the practice of collecting, keeping and using data securely,
   efficiently and cost-effectively

b. it is to help people, organizations and connected things optimize the use of data
   within the bounds of policy and regulations so that they can make decisions and
   take actions that maximize the benefits of the organization

c. create value

d. True

e. collect, organize, process, and manage informations in a structured and 
   controlled manner

f. It is a comprehensive collection of data organized for easy access

g. True

h. - Customer management processes
   - Inventory tracking
   - employee database
   - productivity reporting
   - financial    reporting
   - data analysis
   - supply chain management

i. it is the way in which the informations are structured

j. - Lack of data integration
   - Lack of standards
   - Lack of central control
   - Inconsistency
   - Redundancy
   - Lack of multiple views

k. - Reduced data redundancy
   - Reduced updating errors and increased consistency
   - Greater data integrity
   - Improved data access to users through the use of a host and query languages
   - Improved data security
   - Reduced data entry, storage, and retrieval cost
   - Facilitated development of new application programs
   - centralized control of data
   - can be viewed in multiple ways
   - standard can be easily enforced

l. - they are complex, time-consuming and difficult to design
   - substantial hardware and software start-up costs
   - damage to database affects virually all the applications using it
   - Extensive conversion cost from moving from a file system to a database
   - Initial training required for all programmers and users









2. Database Management Systems are softwares used in managing databases
b. examples
   - MySQL
   - Oracle
   - SQL SERVER
   - PostgreSQL
   - Amazon SimpleDB (cloud based)
   - IBM DB2

c. creation of databases
   creation of tables
   updating data
   storing data 
   e.t.c

d. Data Definition 
   Data Manipulation
   Data Retrieval
   User Administration

e. 
   - Data stored into tables
   - Reduced Redundancy
   - Data Consistency
   - Support multiple users and concurrent Access
   - Query Languages
   - DBMS supports transactions
   
f. Segregation of application program
   With cloud data centers we now have a DBMS that can store almost infinite data
   Easy retrieval of data using the Query language
   Reduced development time and maintenance need
   minimal data duplication or repeatition
   seamless integration into the application programmin language which makes it 
   very easy to add a database to any application or website

g. It's Complexity
   Excepty MySQL, Licensed DBMS are generally costly
   They are large in size
   
h. organizes your files to give you more control over your data
   allows you create, update, retrieve, and even remove data in our db files
   it provides:
       Concurrency
       Security
       Backup and recovery
       Integrity
       Data descriptions

i. Database Administrator (DBA)

j. 

k. True

l. Yes they should

m. Internal Level
   Conceptual Level
   External Level

n. Internal Level - Shows the physical representation of database on the computer,
                    how the data are stored
   Conceptual Lvl - Defines the logical structure of the database, all the entities,
                    attributes, and their relationship.
   External Level - Describes part of the database for a particular group of users,
                    how users see the data

   in a Database










2a. ER Model defines the conceptual view of a database

d. - 
   - 
   
e. Simple       attribute
   Composite    attribute
   Derived      attribute
   Single-value attribute
   Multi-value  attribute

g. A key is an attribute or a collection of attributes that are used to identify
   an entity in an entity set

h. Super key
   Candidate key
   Primary Key

i. Relationship

SECTION 1: Setup


STEP 1:
In other to create an web application e.g A Blog and a News website. 
We need to download `wordpress` and a `server` that helps us develop this

we can download either:
- wamp  server or  (I will be going with wamp for this explanation)
- xampp server

- and then download wordpress


STEP 2: 
- Extract the wordpress and wamp files and setup the below structure in the 
  root of your computers C drive

> C:/wamp/www/wordpress

- Rename the wordpress file to the websites name of your choice.
  In my case, I will be going with `handy`

> C:/wamp/www/handy


STEP 3:
- We want create an account that will allow us develop our websites. 
- Run the Wamp server by clicking on the app icon.
- Visit - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
- Fill form up
    Enter username: root
    Enter password:          # leave password blank
    | go |                   # click the go button

    Enter Username: daniel
    Enter Password: 12345
    Re-type:        12345

STEP 5:
- visit - http://localhost/handy

- | go |                   # click the go button   

- you will be prompted to run wordpress installation. do so

- fill form up
- click 'submit'

- # we should be redirected to our wordpress development environment where we 
  can start developing both of our apps

  - Appearance
    - to see all the available themes we could use (free and paid)
    - to change the theme of our website

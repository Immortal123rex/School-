How To Study the Material

Tips: 
- Best to study using the github repo link
  https://github.com/danielchukwu/School-/tree/master/300Lvl/1st

- Use a laptop or device with a relatively big screen to study
- Glancing through the questions and answers may not cement the knowledge. 
  But answering them as you go through them on some book or paper repeatedly 
  definitely will



COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

1a. Draw the Computer Architecture diagram
 Ans: 

 b. What are the 3 types of Buses?
 Ans: Address Bus, Data Bus, Control Bus

 c. Whenever their is a program, there must always be a __________?
 Ans: Processor

 d. Define Computer Architecture (CA)?
 Ans: This is a science & an art of selecting & interconnecting hardware components to create computers 
      that meet functions, performance and cost goals.

 e. Computers can be broadly categorized into 3 groups. What are their names?
 Ans: i) The Processor.   ii) The Memory.   iii) The Input and Output unit.

 f. Briefly explain what The Processor, The Memory and The Input and Output unit
 Ans: i) The Processor(CPU): It is the brains of the computer. It gives the instructions
      ii) The Memory(RAM): This is the storage unit of the computer. It stores program files and data files
      iii) The Input and Output unit: This is the interface that enables interaction with the computer. It allows us 
                                      give Instructions and recieve responses

 g. The screen of the computer is divided into _______________________?
 Ans: Small Regular Boxes called Pixels.

 h. The more the pixel on the screen, the ________________________?
 Ans: The clearer the picture

 i. In order for coloured pictures to be displayed what happens?
 Ans: Different number of pixels representing colours is used

 j. How are 2 bits and 3 bits pixels stored?
 Ans: 2² => 4
      0 0
      0 1
      1 0
      1 1

      2³ => 8
      0 0 0
      0 0 1
      0 1 0
      0 1 1
      1 0 0
      1 0 1
      1 1 0
      1 1 1

 k. Whose Job is it to fetche instructions, decode it and then execute those instructions?
 Ans: The Processor

 l. What are Buses in computer?
 Ans: These are sets of wires used to transfer data in and out of a computer system

 m. What are the Types of Computer Buses?
 Ans: Address, Data, Control

 i. Explain
 Ans: Address Bus: It holds the address of the location where a particular data is stored
      Data Bus:    It holds the data and transports it into the address location(in & out of the processor/memory)
      Control Bus: It holds the instructions of what is to be done with data (in & out of the memory)

 n. List the 3 steps in the Instruction cycle?
 Ans: Fetch -----> Decode ------> Execute

 i. Explain
 Ans: Fetch: When the processor reads information from the memory
      Decode: Understanding the information/instruction
      Executing: Performing the task or operation

 p. What are the 2 operations that can be performed with the memory?
 Ans: Read or Write
 


LOGIC GATES
a. __________ are basic building block of any digital system?
 Ans: Logic gate

b. How many inputs does a logic gate take?
Ans: 1 and above

c. Explain The AND Gate, The OR GATE and The NOT GATE?
Ans: 
     AND GATE: The output is 1 only when both inputs are 1
     OR GATE:  The output is 1 if atleast 1 of the input is 1
     NOT GATE: The output is 1 if the input is 0. This takes only one input and the result is always the opposite of the input
         
   i. Draw the above GATES and thier TT(Truth Table)
   Ans: 

d. Explain The NAND Gate, The NOR GATE and The EX-OR GATE?
     NAND GATE: The inputs are AND'ED and then the result is NOT'ED
     NOR GATE:  The inputs are OR'ED and then the result is NOT'ED
     EX-OR GATE: c = AB¯ + A¯B
     EX-NOR GATE: c = A¯B¯ + AB
         
   i. Draw the above GATES and thier TT(Truth Table)
   Ans: 

f. List all 10 of the Boolean Laws (Rules)
Ans:
     1. Idempotency Law    A+A = A   | A.A = A
     2. Null Law           A+1 = 1   | A.0 = 0
     3. Identity Law       A+0 = A   | A.1 = A
     4. Commutative Law    A+B = B+A | A.B = B.A
     5. Associative Law    (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)   |    (A.B)C = A(B.C)
     6. Distributive Law   A(B+C) = AB + AC    |    A+BC = (A+B)(A+C) 
     7. Absorbtion Law     A+AB = A            |    A(A+B) = A
     8. Complement Law     A+A¯ = 1            |    A.A¯ = 0
     9. Demorgans Law      (A+B)¯ = A¯.B¯      |    (A.B)¯ = A¯ + B¯
    10. Inverse Law        A¯¯ = A

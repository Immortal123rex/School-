ASSIGNMENT 1st
1) Why is SRAM faster than DRAM?
2) Why do coloured pictures occupy morespace than black & white pictures?


1) Why is SRAM faster than DRAM?
RAM or Random Access Memory is of two types - SRAM (or Static RAM) and DRAM (or Dynamic RAM). 
SRAM does not continuously refresh like the DRAM deos there for making it provide a better performance than the DRAM. 


Further Explanation Why This is:

What is SRAM?
The data in an SRAM is stored in transistors. Each bit of memory is stored using Bistable Latching Circuitry in this RAM. 
The data is stored using the six transistor memory cells.

Since SRAM uses transistors to store data, it requires a constant power supply. Because the power supply is constant, 
SRAM does not need to be refreshed in order to remember the data being stored in it. SRAM is called a static RAM 
because no action is required to recall the stored data.


What is DRAM?
DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. DRAM is the most widely used RAM in computers. The data in a DRAM is 
stored in capacitors. Each bit of data is stored in a separate capacitor inside a particular integrated circuit.

DRAMs have a high power consumption because capacitors tend to leak charge even when they are supplied with continuous
power. Because of the charge leakage, the power supply in DRAMs needs to be refreshed regularly in order to retain 
the data stored in them. This is why these RAMs are called Dynamic.



2) Why do coloured pictures occupy morespace than bllack & white pictures?
Ans: Colors take up the same amount of space. However, pictures aren't stored simply by encoding the color for each 
picture.They use algorithms to compress the data. As an example, they may store the data for one pixel, then store the 
amount of pixels to the left and right that are the same color. Then when the color changes they'll repeat the process.
This would cause pictures with more color changes to take up more space.

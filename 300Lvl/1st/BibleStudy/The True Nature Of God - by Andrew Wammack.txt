Galatians 5:6

2 Peter 1:2
Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.

- We get grace and peace not by praying for it asking God to just hand it to us but we get it through our knowledge
  of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. There is a saying that goes what you don't know, doesn't hurt you and this
  saying is absolutely wrong. What you don't know is hurting and hindering you.

2 Peter 1:3
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the Knowledge
of him that hath called us to glory and virtue

- Notice how the verse says all things, It is Gods will for us to recieve all things through the knowledge of him


2 Peter 3:9
The lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance

James 4:7
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you

Some people think that God is either behind every good and evil thing that happens here on earth or he permits it to happen
which is a big fat lie. The scripture above proves this by saying some things are from God and some things are from the
devil (These things are to be resisted) but sad to say how many people resist the devil

What is the Theory of Computation?
Ans: Its the branch of computer science that deals with how efficiently a problem can be solved on 
     a model of computation using an algorithm.

Three Branches of Theory of Computation 
1. Automata Theory and Language
2. Computability Theory
3. Complexity Theory
 
A. Automata Theory and Language:
   This deals with the definition and properties of various mathematical models of computation 
    E.g Finite Automata
        Context Free Grammar
        Turing Machine

B. Computability Theory
   This deals with what can and what cannot be computed by the model

C. Complexity Theory
   This groups the computable problem based on their hardness


Main Purpose of T.C (Theory of Computation): 
Is to develop formal mathematical model of computation that reflects real world computers.


Basic Definitions (Symbol, Alphabet, String)
1. Symbol: 
      Symbol is a character
      e.g a, b, c, ..., z
          0, 1, 2, ..., 9
          +, -, /, ..., special characters

2. Alphabet:
      An alpabet is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is denoted by sigma(Σ)
      e.g Σ = {0, 1}          // set of binary alphabets
          Σ = {a, b, ... z}   // set of all lowercase letters
          Σ = {+, &, /, ...}  // set of all special characters

3. String or Word:
      A string is a finite set sequence of symbols(or characters) choosen from some alphabet
      e.g 011100110 is a string from binary alphabet Σ={0, 1}
          aabbaacab is a string from lowercase alphabet Σ={a, b, c }

Summary

Symbol  ----------->      Alphabet  ----------> String
 ↓                            ↓                   ↓
a, 1, 0                    Σ={0, 1}              01101001 (gotten from Σ={0, 1})
                           Σ={a, b, ...}         abbcd    (gotten from Σ={abcd})




4. Empty String: 
       The empty string is the string with zero occrences of symbols(no symbols). It is denoted by epsilon (ε). No symbols


5. Length of String:
       It is the number of symbols in the string/word. It is denoted by |w|
       e.g: w = 010110101 from binary alphabet Σ={0,1}
            The length of string |w| = 9

6. Concatenation Of String:
       Join 2 or more strings
       e.g let a = a1a2a3 .... an & y = b1b2b3 ... bn
           concatenation xy = a1a2a3 ... anb1b2b3 ... bn

           S=ababab & t=cdcddc
           Concatenation st=abababcdcddc


Power of an Alphabet
=> If "Σ" is an alphabet. we can express set of all string of certain length from that alphabet by 
   using exponential notation. It is denoted by Σ^K is the set of strings of length k.

viability of the idea, considering factors such as market demand, competition, 
costs, revenue potential, and available resources.

It is important for Mrs. Eze to conduct a feasibility study before investing in 
any project because it helps her to make an informed decision about whether to 
proceed with the project. By conducting a thorough and comprehensive feasibility 
study, Mrs. Eze can identify potential challenges and risks, as well as assess 
the potential benefits and rewards of the project. This will allow her to make an 
informed decision about whether to invest her time, money, and resources into the 
project, and to plan and prepare effectively for its implementation.

In short, conducting a feasibility study before investing in a project is a smart 
and necessary step for entrepreneurs to take, as it helps to minimize the risks 
associated with starting a new business and increase the chances of success.
